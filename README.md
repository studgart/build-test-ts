**Universal Actions** are GitHub Composite Actions that are highly reusable, maintainable and can adapt to work with multiple types of project. They are born to abstract the underlying commands and logics to achieve a specific task, enabling DevOps Engineers to focus on the most crucial parts of their implementation and reduce an amount of time to repeatedly write these actions.

**Build and Test TS/JS Applications** is an Universal Action created to run basic steps such as install, build, and test (if any) with highly customizable configuration.
